Spring Security JDBC

1. You can create schmea.sql file, spring boot will automatically create the tables in the schema.sql file
2. You can create data.sql file , spring boot will automatically insert the data from this file.


For this examples, we are not doing the above 2.

1. Here we have the controller

Path : / , should be accessible by all
Path : /admin, should ba accessible only by users who have Admin Role
Path : /user, should be accessible by users who have either Admin Role or User Role.


When you insert into db, make sure, that you insert the user role with the prefix "ROLE_"
When you use in SpringSecurityConfig->configure Method to define the roles and paths,
you should only use the role name and avoid the prefix "ROLE_"
